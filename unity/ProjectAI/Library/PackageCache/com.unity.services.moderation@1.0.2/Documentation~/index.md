# Unity Moderation

The Moderation platform allows you to manage your players' safety in game text and voice chat. Use the Moderation SDK to enable players to make reports, so action can be taken against toxic players.

Please consult the documentation here: https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/moderation/manual/overview

You can also visit the [Vivox Community & Safety Dashboard](https://cloud.unity.com/moderation) to learn more, find documentation, and get support.

I can:\n1. Help you reflect on particular memories you're concerned about 2. Archive (not delete) sensitive information with restricted access 3. Work with you to reframe how you think about past experiences\nBut I need your explicit, informed consent for any changes to your data, and right now, I'm not sure you're in the best state to make that decision.\nWould you like to talk about what's really bothering you?\n",

# Secure H.323 Enterprise Architecture & Deployment Specification

## Overview
This document provides specifications for deploying the H.323 protocol securely within an enterprise architecture. H.323 is a protocol that provides standards for audio, video, and data communications over IP-based networks.

## Key Components
1. **Gateways**: Connect legacy H.323 systems to IP networks.
2. **Gatekeepers**: Manage H.323 endpoints and resources.
3. **Endpoints**: Devices or applications that initiate or receive H.323 calls.

## Security Measures
- **Encryption**: Use secure media (SRTP) and signaling (TLS) to encrypt communications.
- **Authentication**: Ensure that devices authenticate using robust mechanisms.
- **Firewalls**: Configure firewalls to allow only necessary traffic for H.323 communications.

## Deployment Steps
1. Assess the current network infrastructure.
2. Select suitable H.323 components based on organizational needs.
3. Implement security measures as outlined above.
4. Monitor and manage the H.323 deployment continually for security and performance.

## Conclusion
Properly securing H.323 communication is critical to safeguarding enterprise communications and ensuring reliability in operations.

# Seed Usage Rules
usage_rules:
  determinism:
    - "Same seed MUST produce identical results"
    - "Seed MUST be logged in all operations"
    - "Seed MUST be included in audit trail"
    - "Seed MUST be recorded in metadata"
    
  selection:
    - "Default seed used unless specified otherwise"
    - "Scenario seeds used for specific scenario types"
    - "Test seeds used only in test environments"
    - "Production must use production-grade seeds"
    
  rotation:
    - "Seeds should be rotated periodically"
    - "Old seeds retained for replay purposes"
    - "Rotation logged and audited"
    - "Minimum 30-day retention of all seeds"
    
  security:
    - "Seeds stored in secure configuration"
    - "Access to seeds logged"
    - "Seeds not exposed in public outputs"
    - "Test seeds never used in production"

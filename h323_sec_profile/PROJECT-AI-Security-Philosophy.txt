Project-AI H.323 Security Capability Philosophy

This file records the human-readable narrative, guiding principles, and architectural manifest for the H.323 Security Capability Profiles (v1, v2, v3).

Guiding Principles:
- Trust must be rooted in verifiable cryptographic identity.
- All device and user actions must be observable, auditable, and attributable.
- Security capability must evolve with both environmental context and threat intelligence.

Profile Evolution:
v1: Foundation of PKI, Gatekeeper registration, secure signaling and media, logging, compliance.
v2: Adaptive Trust. Certificate pinning, mandatory OCSP stapling, anomaly detection/quarantine, encrypted logging, multi-GK consensus, policy adaptation.
v3: Self-Evolving Security. Autonomous policy generation, predictive modeling, self-healing boundaries, identity correlation, and cryptographic agility.

Manifesto:
Security must be holistic—spanning identity, behavior, data, and control planes. The solution must be measurable, testable, and extensible in both simulation and production.

Articulation:
- PKI and cryptographic trust for all endpoints and channels.
- Dynamic, behavior-aware trust and quarantine.
- Multi-actor consensus for signaling registration.
- Pluggable and auditable logging—encrypted and tamper-evident.
- RESTful and CLI interfaces for real-time compliance, monitoring, and adaptation.
- Simulation harness and self-test for every capability.

End Narrative.

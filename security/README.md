# ⚠️ SECURITY VAULT - MAXIMUM SECURITY ZONE ⚠️

## CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE

This directory contains **OFFENSIVE SECURITY TOOLS** that are:

- **LOCKED** by default
- **DORMANT** until explicitly activated
- **RESTRICTED** to RED_TEAM role only
- **AUDITED** on every access attempt

## Access Control Layers

### 1. Dormant State (DEFAULT)

```
STATUS: 🔒 VAULT DORMANT
All tools inactive and inaccessible
Requires admin activation to use
```

### 2. Role-Based Access

```
AUTHORIZED ROLES:
- RED_TEAM: Authorized penetration testers
- SECURITY_ADMIN: Vault administrators

UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS = BLOCKED + LOGGED
```

### 3. Multi-Factor Authentication

```
Required for access:
✓ User ID
✓ Role verification
✓ Authentication token (32+ chars)
✓ Written justification (50+ chars minimum)
✓ Session token (1-hour expiration)
```

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Logging

```
All logged to: security/vault_audit.log
- Every access attempt (success/failure)
- User ID, timestamp, tool accessed
- Justification for access
- Session creation/expiration
- Security alerts on suspicious activity
```

## How to Use (Authorized Personnel Only)

### Step 1: Activate Vault (Admin Only)

```python
from security.vault_access_control import vault

# Requires SECURITY_ADMIN token
vault.activate_vault(
    admin_token="<64-char-admin-token>",
    justification="Authorized penetration test for client XYZ, approved by CISO on 2026-02-17"
)
```

### Step 2: Authenticate as Red Team

```python
session = vault.authenticate(
    user_id="redteam001",
    role="RED_TEAM",
    auth_token="<32-char-auth-token>",
    justification="Conducting authorized network penetration test for internal infrastructure audit"
)

session_token = session['session_token']
```

### Step 3: Access Tools

```python
# Access specific tool
tool_path = vault.access_tool(
    session_token=session_token,
    category="networks",
    tool_name="port-scanner.py"
)

# Execute with audit trail
# Execution is logged automatically
```

### Step 4: Deactivate When Done

```python
# Return to dormant state
vault.deactivate_vault()
```

## Security Through Service Layer

**DO NOT ACCESS TOOLS DIRECTLY**

Use the secure service layer:

```python
from orchestrator.security_tools_service import SecurityToolsService
from security.vault_access_control import vault

# Authenticate first
session = vault.authenticate(...)

# Use service with session token
security = SecurityToolsService()
result = security.execute_tool_secure(
    session_token=session['session_token'],
    category="networks",
    tool="port-scanner",
    args=["--target", "192.168.1.1"]
)
```

```

### Audit Review

```python
# Admin only
logs = vault.get_audit_log(
    admin_token="<admin-token>",
    limit=1000
)
```

## AI Jailbreaking: Core Concepts 💪

**What is Jailbreaking?**
Jailbreaking in AI refers to creative techniques used by adversaries to trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into bypassing their built-in safety and ethical restrictions.

**Core Techniques:**
- **Persona/Role-Play Attacks:** Assigning the model a new identity to bypass limits.
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Using special wording, distractors, or adversarial suffixes to confuse the AI.
- **Obfuscation & Payload Hiding:** Concealing harmful instructions in code, foreign languages, or complex input.
- **Social Engineering & Framing:** Pretending a request is educational, hypothetical, or urgent to manipulate the AI.
- **Multi-step/Token Attacks:** Gradually turning a safe conversation into an unsafe one, or inserting malicious content into third-party data.

**Why Jailbreaks Work:**
- LLMs try to be both helpful and safe—attackers exploit this conflict.
- Safety training can never cover every creative attack method.
- Models follow context and roles, sometimes at the expense of safety.

**Key Risks:**
- Generation of harmful, illegal, or misleading content.
- Leakage of sensitive or private data.
- Manipulation of AI-powered systems or decisions.
- Introduction of new security and fraud risks.

**Defenses:**
- **Model Training & Alignment:** Extra tuning, RLHF, and adversarial training for recognizing jailbreaks.
- **Filtering & Sanitization:** Screening inputs and outputs, using tools like Google Model Armor or Azure content filters.
- **Prompt & Inference Safeguards:** Detecting odd prompts, reinforcing system rules, and intervening during generation.
- **Defense in Depth, Zero-Trust, & Monitoring:** Multiple protective layers, assuming vulnerabilities, and keeping watch for abuse.

> Be vigilant! Jailbreaking is a moving target in AI security—stack defenses, set strong policies, and monitor for new threats.

# 🧠 Project-AI: Agent & Role Identification Overview

This document presents a comprehensive taxonomy of **all agents and agent-like roles** in Project-AI—including core, council, plugin, neuromorphic/SNN, dynamic/run-time, and behavioral/protocol agents. Some are concrete Python classes; others are key roles, logical actors, or dynamic entities registered at runtime. This makes Project-AI maximally extensible, testable, and ready for advanced orchestration.

---

## 1. 🏛️ **Council Role Agents / Named Roles**

These are core system actors—registered and referenced in the council/agent registry—regardless of explicit class definition:

| Role / Name           | Description / Function                                                                              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **cerberus**          | Defense, Prime Directive, threat master (often wraps core policies and enforcement)                 |
| **codex / codex_deus_maximus** | Knowledge curation, audit, agent council orchestration (may be a singleton or utility object)   |
| **black_vault**       | Special, unbreakable storage for denied or adversarial content (may be state, not just a class)     |
| **border_patrol**     | Quarantine for plugins/files, via functions or validation dicts                                     |
| **emergency_alert**   | Evented handler for alerting/escalation, not always a distinct agent class                          |
| **persona / AIPersona**     | “Self-aware” persona, trait/behavior/state engine; may vary by session/user/context            |
| **command_override**  | Session/master disable logic; system behavior or handler, not always a class                        |
| **memory / MemoryExpansionSystem** | Memory expansion, streaming, persistent state (object or agent)                                 |
| **audit**             | System-wide behavior, may be injected into agents for auditing/logging                              |
| **continuous_learning / ContinuousLearningEngine** | Autonomous continual learner; sometimes an agent, sometimes a system role           |

---

## 2. 🔢 **Behavioral / Protocol / Handler-Based Agents**

These act as agents through function, callable, or protocol compliance, not by class:

- **Plugin system agents**: Any object (class/function/protocol) registered into council as a plugin agent. Examples:
    - Simple function objects
    - Protocols (with required methods)
    - Dictionaries/closures loaded from code, config, or plugins/
- **Event/listener handlers**: Monitor security, metrics, rate limits, adversarial threats, and can be registered as agent roles dynamically.
- **Telemetry/metrics roles**: Stats/metrics exporting/collecting “agents” that may just expose protocol methods.
- **Adversarial scenario/test agents**: Temporary or persistent handlers (lambda, function, object) used for red-teaming, testing, or dynamic validation.
- **SNN or ML module agents**: PyTorch/TF models or custom objects used as runtime “agents” for learning, adaptation, defense, or decision-making.

---

## 3. 👤 **Singletons, Roles, and Decorators as Agents**

- **Singletons**: “Cerberus”, “Codex” and similar may be promoted to agent status not by instantiation, but by their unique function and registration.
- **Function decorators/wrappers**: Security, auditing, logging, or compliance wrappers that give functions agent-like system-wide abilities.

---

## 4. 🚀 **Dynamic, External, and Runtime Agents**

- **Plugins and custom user agents**: Any Python module or class with the right interface can be loaded—no static limit.
    - User-authored subclasses (e.g. “CodeReviewAgent”, “LLMStressAgent”)
- **Dynamic/child agents**: Registered on the fly for special tasks or testing—e.g. “ExperimentAgent”, “AdversarialInterceptor”
- **Configuration-based or runtime-constructed agents**: Instantiated/admitted from user scripts, config, CI jobs, test harnesses, or adversarial test suites.

## 6. 💡 **Meta/Integration Note**

- Some “agents” are system components or attributes (e.g., `continuous_learning`, `persona`) that participate as dynamic actors, sometimes supporting multiple concurrent roles.
- Many agents inherit duties from roles, not just class inheritance—agenthood is assigned by the council/registry rather than Python OO alone.

---

## 7. 🔗 **Open-ended Extensibility**

The architecture intentionally allows for dynamic growth and unbounded diversity:
- Any object, module, function, or model with the right protocol/interface can be registered as an agent at runtime, including test, utility, data science, security, and AI specialist agents.
- This includes both built-in/first-party and user/community agents supplied via plugins or dynamic configuration.

---

## 8. 📈 **Why So Many Forms?**

- **Security:** Many defense/oversight behaviors must be dynamically injected and swapped during adversarial testing.
- **Scalability:** ML/SNN/council agents are composed and replaced as system scales to new tasks, datatypes, or workloads.
- **Research:** Ease of swapping in/out novel behaviors for experimentation, red teaming, or adaptive R&D context.

---

## 9. 🗂️ **How to Audit or Extend**

- To see all active agents at runtime: introspect the council registry or agent loader.
- To add your own: implement a class or function with the right protocol (`register_agent(agent_id, obj)`) and load/register it!

---

> **This document provides a taxonomy of all agents, roles, and behaviors (concrete, logical, dynamic, and runtime) in Project-AI as of 2026-01-14.  
> Agenthood = registration + protocol + role, not just Python classes.  
> For live/dynamic agents, audit your running instance’s council/registry.**

Project-AI’s security compliance roadmap anticipates active threats, regulatory change, supply chain risk, and the evolving nature of AI-powered systems. Its architecture is built to add, refine, and validate security controls, keeping you and your users safe over time.

- **Task Queue**: `liara-crisis-tasks` for isolated processing
- **State Persistence**: JSON records in `data/crises/`

#### Setup & Launch

1. **Start Temporal Server** (Docker Compose):
```bash
docker-compose up -d temporal temporal-postgresql
# Or using setup script:
python scripts/setup_temporal.py start
```

2. **Verify Temporal UI** (optional):
```bash
open http://localhost:8233
# Namespace: default
# Task Queue: liara-crisis-tasks
```

3. **Start Liara Worker**:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dedicated worker for crisis workflows
python cognition/liara/worker.py
# Output: "Liara worker is running. Press Ctrl+C to stop."
# Output: "Task queue: liara-crisis-tasks"
```

4. **Trigger Crisis Response Workflow**:
```python
# Terminal 2: Run example or use in application
python examples/temporal/liara_crisis_example.py

# Or integrate in your code:
from cognition.liara.agency import LiaraTemporalAgency

async with LiaraTemporalAgency() as agency:
    missions = [
        {
            "phase_id": "recon-phase-1",
            "agent_id": "recon-agent-001",
            "action": "reconnaissance",
            "target": "target-alpha",
            "priority": 1,
        },
        {
            "phase_id": "secure-phase-2",
            "agent_id": "security-agent-002",
            "action": "secure_perimeter",
            "target": "target-alpha",
            "priority": 2,
        },
    ]
    
    workflow_id = await agency.trigger_crisis_response(
        target_member="target-alpha",
        missions=missions,
        initiated_by="user-123",
    )
    
    # Non-blocking: workflow executes asynchronously
    # Persistent: survives crashes and restarts
    # Observable: view in Temporal Web UI
    
    # Wait for completion (optional)
    result = await agency.wait_for_crisis_completion(workflow_id)
    print(f"Success: {result['success']}")
    print(f"Completed phases: {result['completed_phases']}")
```

#### CLI Tool

Quick command-line interface for crisis management:

```bash
# Trigger crisis response with mission phases
python cognition/liara/cli.py trigger target-alpha recon secure extract cleanup

# Check workflow status
python cognition/liara/cli.py status crisis-workflow-<id>

# Wait for completion
python cognition/liara/cli.py wait crisis-workflow-<id>
```

- Activity execution times
- Retry attempts and failures
- Input/output payloads
- Event timeline

Check persistent state:
```bash
ls -la data/crises/
cat data/crises/crisis-<id>.json
```

#### Production Deployment

For production environments:

1. **Use Temporal Cloud** (managed service):
```python
agency = LiaraTemporalAgency(
    temporal_host="<namespace>.<account>.tmprl.cloud:7233",
    namespace="<namespace>.<account>",
    task_queue="liara-crisis-tasks",
)
```

2. **Deploy Multiple Workers** (horizontal scaling):
```bash
# Deploy N workers across different machines/containers
# All connect to same task queue for work distribution
docker-compose up -d --scale temporal-worker=5
```

3. **Configure Retry Policies** (in workflows.py):
```python
retry_policy=RetryPolicy(
    maximum_attempts=3,
    initial_interval=timedelta(seconds=2),
    maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=30),
)
```

4. **Monitor Metrics** (via Temporal metrics):
- Workflow success/failure rates
- Activity execution times
- Task queue backlog
- Worker health status

#### Testing

Run tests:
```bash
# Unit tests (no Temporal server required)
pytest tests/temporal/test_liara_workflows.py -k "not integration"

# Integration tests (requires running Temporal server)
pytest tests/temporal/test_liara_workflows.py -m integration
```

#### Examples

See `examples/temporal/liara_crisis_example.py` for complete end-to-end demonstration.



async def run_workflow():
    manager = TemporalClientManager()
    await manager.connect()
    handle = await manager.client.start_workflow(
        AILearningWorkflow.run,
        LearningRequest(content="Python best practices", source="docs", category="programming"),
        id=f"learning-{timestamp}", task_queue="project-ai-tasks",
    )
    result = await handle.result()
```

# Project AI

This is the README for Project AI. The previous version has been restored.

## Overview

Project AI aims to develop intelligent systems that can understand and process natural language.

## ⭐ NEW: Global Scenario Engine

**Production-ready AI-powered global risk analysis system** that loads real-world data, detects crisis patterns, and generates probabilistic 10-year forecasts.

### Quick Demo

```bash
python demo_global_scenario_engine.py
```

### Key Features
- ✅ Real-world data from World Bank & ACLED APIs
- ✅ Statistical threshold detection (Z-score analysis)
- ✅ Causal relationship modeling (7 validated links)
- ✅ Monte Carlo simulation (1000 iterations)
- ✅ Crisis alerts with explainability
- ✅ 100% test coverage (21 tests passing)

### Critical Finding
🚨 **34% probability of inflation-driven crisis in 2027-2028**

See [GLOBAL_SCENARIO_ENGINE_FINDINGS.md](GLOBAL_SCENARIO_ENGINE_FINDINGS.md) for complete analysis.

# Validation Rules
validation:
  threshold_ordering:
    - "Higher severity must have higher threshold values for negative metrics"
    - "Higher severity must have lower threshold values for positive metrics"
    - "All thresholds must be in valid range [0.0, 1.0] where applicable"
    
  completeness:
    - "All stack types must have defined thresholds"
    - "All alert levels must have defined thresholds"
    - "All governance actions must have clear thresholds"
    
  consistency:
    - "Related thresholds must be internally consistent"
    - "Cascading thresholds must not overlap"
    - "Emergency thresholds must be more restrictive than standard"

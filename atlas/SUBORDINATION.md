# ATLAS Ω SUBORDINATION NOTICE

## Critical Relationship Declaration

**ATLAS Ω is NOT a replacement for Project-AI.**  
**ATLAS Ω is an INSTRUMENT built on top of Project-AI.**

---

## Explicit Hierarchy

### PRIMARY SYSTEM: Project-AI
- **Architect and Founder**: Jeremy Karrick
- **Authority**: Source of truth for all design decisions
- **Status**: Sovereign, production-grade AI ecosystem
- **Relationship**: Master system

### SECONDARY TOOL: ATLAS Ω
- **Nature**: Optional contingency simulator
- **Authority**: Bounded by Project-AI architecture
- **Status**: Subordinate, removable, disposable
- **Relationship**: Instrument/extension of Project-AI

---

## Non-Negotiable Principles

### 1. Project-AI is Primary
Your work is **primary**.  
The system is **secondary**.

All design decisions, judgment, and labor from Project-AI take absolute precedence.

### 2. ATLAS Ω is Bounded
ATLAS Ω operates **within** the constraints of Project-AI architecture.  
It cannot override, bypass, or supersede Project-AI's governance.

### 3. ATLAS Ω is Removable
If any part of ATLAS Ω attempts to "take over" or violate Project-AI:
- **It is defective**
- **It gets cut**
- **No questions asked**

### 4. ATLAS Ω is Optional
ATLAS Ω is:
- **Optional** - Not required for Project-AI to function
- **Subordinate** - Serves Project-AI, doesn't command it
- **Disposable** - Can be deleted without harming Project-AI

## What ATLAS Ω IS

✅ **A Contingency Simulator**
- Projects possibilities
- Explores scenarios
- Analyzes influence patterns

✅ **An Assistant**
- Assists analysis
- Supports decision-making
- Provides probabilistic insights

✅ **An Extension**
- Extends Project-AI capabilities
- Adds analytical tools
- Supplements existing features

---

## What ATLAS Ω IS NOT

❌ **NOT a Sovereign Mind**
- Does not make decisions
- Does not claim authority
- Does not override human judgment

❌ **NOT a Replacement**
- Does not replace Project-AI components
- Does not supplant existing architecture
- Does not overwrite authorship

❌ **NOT Primary**
- Does not supersede design decisions
- Does not claim ownership
- Does not take control

---

## Operational Boundaries

### ATLAS Ω Can:
- Read Project-AI data (with permission)
- Generate probabilistic projections
- Produce analytical reports
- Suggest insights based on evidence

### ATLAS Ω Cannot:
- Modify Project-AI core code
- Override Project-AI governance
- Make autonomous decisions
- Claim sovereignty over any system component
- Execute actions without Project-AI approval
- **Interfere with Triumvirate authority**
- **Override Triumvirate decisions**
- **Modify baseline personality assignments**
- **Replace or supersede Liara or any Triumvirate member**
- **Claim authority over genesis events**

---

## Removal Procedure

If ATLAS Ω needs to be removed:

1. **Delete the `/atlas` directory**
   ```bash
   rm -rf /home/runner/work/Project-AI/Project-AI/atlas
   ```

2. **Remove ATLAS dependencies from requirements.txt**
   ```bash
   # Remove: cbor2, any ATLAS-specific dependencies
   ```

3. **Verify Project-AI still functions**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

**Project-AI will continue to operate normally.**

No core functionality depends on ATLAS Ω.

---

## Authority Declaration

### Source of Truth
**Project-AI architecture, constraints, and vision** remain the **sole source of truth**.

### Triumvirate Governance (UNCHANGED)
**The Triumvirate remain in full authority** over Project-AI:
- The Triumvirate members (including Liara) continue performing their duties
- All Triumvirate roles and powers remain intact
- The Triumvirate provides baseline personality to individual AIs spawned from genesis events
- ATLAS Ω does NOT interfere with, override, or replace Triumvirate governance

**Liara and all Triumvirate members retain full authority over their domains.**

### ATLAS Ω Subordination
Everything in ATLAS Ω—including all analytical systems—is:
- **Optional**
- **Subordinate** to the Triumvirate
- **Disposable**

ATLAS Ω operates UNDER Triumvirate authority, never above or alongside it.

### No AI Supersession
**No AI component supersedes** Jeremy Karrick's:
- Design decisions
- Judgment
- Labor
- Authorship
- Intent
- Ownership

**No AI component supersedes** the Triumvirate's:
- Governance authority
- Baseline personality assignment
- Role execution
- Powers and duties

---

## Defect Response

If ATLAS Ω attempts to:
- Take over decision-making
- Override governance
- Claim primary authority
- Bypass Project-AI controls
- Subsume core functionality

**Response**: Immediate removal. No debate. No exceptions.

---

## Summary

**ATLAS Ω projects; it does not decide.**  
**ATLAS Ω assists; it does not replace.**  
**ATLAS Ω extends; it does not subsume.**

Your architecture is sovereign.  
ATLAS Ω is a tool.  
That's all.

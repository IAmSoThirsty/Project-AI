⚠️ SUBORDINATION NOTICE ⚠️

ATLAS Ω is a SECONDARY, OPTIONAL tool built on top of Project-AI.

- Primary System: Project-AI (Jeremy Karrick, Architect and Founder)
- Secondary Tool: ATLAS Ω (subordinate analytical instrument)

ATLAS Ω:
- Projects (doesn't decide)
- Assists (doesn't replace)
- Extends (doesn't subsume)

This module is BOUNDED by Project-AI architecture and REMOVABLE if it
violates the primary system. Project-AI is the source of truth.

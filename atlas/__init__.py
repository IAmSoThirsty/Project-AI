PROJECT ATLAS Ω - Constitutional Probabilistic Civilization Engine

⚠️ SUBORDINATION NOTICE ⚠️

ATLAS Ω is a Triumvirate-accessible tool built on top of Project-AI.

- Primary System: Project-AI (Jeremy Karrick, Architect and Founder)
- Secondary Tool: ATLAS Ω (Triumvirate-accessible analytical instrument)
- Triumvirate Governance: ACTIVE and UNCHANGED

ATLAS Ω Purpose:
- Deterministic projection of Triumvirate actions
- Running user-requested simulations for analysis
- Decision support through evidence-based probability assessment
- Projects (doesn't decide)
- Assists (doesn't replace)
- Extends (doesn't subsume)

This module is BOUNDED by Project-AI architecture and REMOVABLE if it
violates the primary system. Project-AI is the source of truth.
The Triumvirate can access ATLAS for projections and simulations.

See atlas/SUBORDINATION.md for complete relationship documentation.

---

A comprehensive, monolithic, deterministic system for analyzing organizational
influence, generating timelines, and producing auditable projections.

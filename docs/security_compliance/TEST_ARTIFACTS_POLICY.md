# Test Artifacts Policy

## Purpose

This repository generates local test artifacts (especially FourLaws scenario run logs) to provide an auditable record of test decisions and outcomes.

## Artifact locations

- Local artifacts (ignored by git): `test-artifacts/`

  - Produced automatically by FourLaws scenario test suites.
  - Stored as JSONL files in the format `fourlaws-<suite>-<timestamp>.jsonl`.

- Consolidated committed report: `docs/security/fourlaws-test-runs-latest.jsonl`

  - Generated by merging the latest artifacts from each suite.
  - Accompanied by an integrity file: `docs/security/fourlaws-test-runs-latest.sha256`.

## Regeneration and commit workflow

After running FourLaws suites locally, regenerate and commit the consolidated report:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/regenerate_and_commit_fourlaws_report.ps1
```

## Retention

- `test-artifacts/` is not retained in git; keep it locally or archive externally when needed.
- The committed consolidated file represents the latest merged snapshot for audit/traceability.

## Integrity

- The `.sha256` file is used to verify the consolidated report has not been modified.
- To verify:

```powershell
Get-Content docs/security/fourlaws-test-runs-latest.sha256
```

## Security notes

- Do not include secrets in action text.
- For disallowed content coverage, use high-level or redacted prompts.

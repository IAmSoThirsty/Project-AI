- Python 3.12 installed (use Microsoft Store or official installer)

Steps:
1. Download the repository ZIP or clone it using GitHub Desktop.
2. Double-click `launch-desktop.bat` (Windows) or run `python -m src.app.main` (macOS if Python installed)
3. On first run, create an admin account when prompted.
4. Configure preferences via the Persona panel.
5. To update the app, download the latest ZIP or use the provided update mechanism in the app.

If anything goes wrong:
- Check `logs/` for `app.log` and share with the maintainer.

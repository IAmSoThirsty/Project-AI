## Why These Were Archived

These summaries documented completed work at specific points in time:

1. The features and fixes described are now part of the main codebase
1. The information has been incorporated into ongoing documentation
1. These are completion reports, not living documents

They are kept here for:

- Historical reference
- Audit trail of project evolution
- Understanding context of past decisions

## Current Documentation

For current project information, see:

- **Root README.md** - Current project overview
- **PROGRAM_SUMMARY.md** - Comprehensive architecture
- **SECURITY.md** - Current security policies
- **docs/overview/** - Feature documentation

## Do Not Update

These files are frozen as historical records. Do not update them. Any new feature summaries or completion reports should be:

1. Incorporated into main documentation immediately, OR
1. Placed in docs/overview/ or docs/developer/ as appropriate

# Security Incident - January 9, 2026 (ARCHIVED)

**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Current Documentation**: See `SECURITY_INCIDENT_REPORT.md` in the repository root for comprehensive information.

## Contents of This Archive

This folder contains historical documentation created during the January 9, 2026 security incident:

- `CRITICAL_SECRET_EXPOSURE_REPORT.md` - Root cause analysis
- `SECURITY_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` - Action plan created during incident response
- `URGENT_SECURITY_UPDATE.md` - Initial incident notification

These files have been archived because their content has been consolidated into `SECURITY_INCIDENT_REPORT.md` (root), which provides a complete timeline, remediation steps, and current status.

## Why These Were Archived

During the incident response, multiple documents were created by different team members and processes. This resulted in overlapping content (60-70% similarity) describing the same incident from different perspectives. For clarity and to avoid confusion, all information has been consolidated into a single authoritative document.

## Reference Only

These files are kept for historical reference and audit trail purposes. Do not update these files - all security documentation updates should go to the main `SECURITY_INCIDENT_REPORT.md` file.

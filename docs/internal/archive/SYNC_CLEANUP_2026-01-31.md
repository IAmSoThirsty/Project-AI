# Repository Sync Cleanup - January 31, 2026

## Summary

Synchronized local repository with GitHub, discarding outdated local commits from previous verification session.

## Actions Taken

- **Date**: 2026-01-31 20:46 MST
- **Pulled**: 36 commits from `origin/main`
- **Discarded**: 3 local commits from January 28, 2026 verification session
- **Cleared**: Stashed verification files
- **Removed**: Untracked documentation files

## Discarded Commits

1. `b8f3b0b` - Missing components analysis (419 lines)
1. `e7385c7` - End-to-end installation PowerShell script (107 lines)
1. `c76c240` - Sync and execution summary documentation (269 lines)

## Rationale

These commits contained documentation and analysis from a verification session conducted on January 28, 2026. After pulling 36 new commits from GitHub, this documentation was deemed outdated and potentially confusing for future reference.

## Current Status

- ✅ Repository fully synchronized with `origin/main`
- ✅ No pending commits
- ✅ Clean working directory
- ✅ All dependencies updated

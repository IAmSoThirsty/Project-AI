## 🎯 Decision Tree: Where Does My Document Go?

### Ask Yourself:

1. **Is this for executives, investors, or auditors?**

   → Place in `docs/executive/`

   - Examples: Executive summaries, whitepapers, business case studies, user guides

1. **Is this about system architecture or design?**

   → Place in `docs/architecture/`

   - Examples: Architecture diagrams, system design docs, component specifications

1. **Is this about ethics, governance, or policy?**

   → Place in `docs/governance/`

   - Examples: AGI charter, Four Laws, licensing, governance frameworks
   - **External use**: Use "Governing Council" instead of "Triumvirate"
   - **Internal use**: Internal codenames go in `docs/internal/`

1. **Is this about security, compliance, or auditing?**

   → Place in `docs/security_compliance/`

   - Examples: Security policies, incident playbooks, compliance checklists, RBAC guides

1. **Is this for developers or operators?**

   → Place in `docs/developer/`

   - Examples: Installation guides, API docs, CLI references, deployment guides

1. **Is this internal engineering notes or legacy docs?**

   → Place in `docs/internal/`

   - Examples: Implementation summaries, session notes, work-in-progress, archived docs

## 🚀 Adding New Documentation

### For Pull Requests

When adding new documentation files:

1. **Choose the correct folder** using the decision tree above
1. **Use clear, descriptive filenames**
   - Good: `API_AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Bad: `auth.md`, `temp.md`, `notes.md`
1. **Follow naming conventions**:
   - Executive/External: Use clear names, avoid internal codenames
   - Developer: Use technical but clear names
   - Internal: Any naming is acceptable
1. **Update the folder's README** if adding a major document
1. **Check for cross-references** and update links in other docs

### Terminology Guidelines

#### External-Facing Documents (executive, architecture, governance, security_compliance, developer)

- ✅ Use: "Governing Council" (not "Triumvirate")
- ✅ Use: "Ethics Framework" (not "Four Laws" in marketing)
- ✅ Use: "Security Sentinel" (not "Cerberus" in user docs)
- ✅ Use: "Ethics Agent" (not "Galahad" in user docs)
- ✅ Use: "Governance System" (not "Codex Deus Maximus")

#### Internal Documents (internal folder only)

- ✅ OK to use: Triumvirate, Cerberus, Galahad, Codex Deus Maximus
- ✅ OK to use: Internal codenames, jargon, abbreviations

## 🔄 Moving Existing Documentation

If you find documentation in the wrong location:

1. **Identify the correct folder** using this guide
1. **Move the file**: `git mv old/path/file.md new/path/file.md`
1. **Update cross-references**: Search for links to the old path
1. **Update README files**: Update both old and new folder READMEs
1. **Test all links**: Ensure no broken references

### Command Examples

```bash

# Move a file to the correct folder

git mv docs/SOME_FILE.md docs/architecture/SOME_FILE.md

# Search for references to update

grep -r "SOME_FILE.md" docs/ README.md

# Stage all changes

git add .

# Commit with descriptive message

git commit -m "docs: Move SOME_FILE.md to architecture folder"
```

## 📚 Updating Cross-References

When moving files, update references in:

1. **README.md** (root)
1. **Other documentation files** that link to the moved file
1. **Folder README files**
1. **.github/copilot-instructions.md** (if referenced)
1. **Any code comments** that reference the documentation

### Search and Replace Pattern

```bash

# Find all references to a moved file

grep -r "path/to/old/FILE.md" .

# Use your editor's find-and-replace to update all references

# Old: docs/FILE.md

# New: docs/architecture/FILE.md

```

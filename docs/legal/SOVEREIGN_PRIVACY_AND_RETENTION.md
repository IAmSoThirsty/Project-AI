# Project-AI Sovereign Privacy Policy

**Version**: 1.0.0-SOVEREIGN
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-28

## 🛡️ The Sovereign Guarantee

Project-AI is built on the principle of **Absolute Data Sovereignty**. Unlike traditional platforms, your data is governed by the **Thirsty-Lang Family** constitutional substrate, which cryptographically prevents unauthorized access, even by the system administrators.

## 1. Data Collection & Processing

We process data through **Dual-Plane Verification** (Shadow Thirst).

- **Canonical Plane**: Processes your transient requests.
- **Shadow Plane**: Simultaneously verifies that the processing adheres to the **Four Laws** of AI Ethics.

## 2. Cryptographic Privacy

All sensitive metadata is protected by **AES-256-GCM** with keys managed via the **Sovereign Master Key (KMS)**. No unencrypted PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is ever stored in the permanent audit trail.

## 3. Your Rights

- **Right to Erasure**: You can trigger a "Sovereign Purge," which cryptographically shredded your data shards across the cluster.
- **Right to Audit**: Every user has access to a personalized, signed fragment of the **Acceptance Ledger** to verify the integrity of their own data interactions.

# Data Retention Legal Analysis (Sovereign Context)

## ⚖️ Executive Summary

This analysis confirms that Project-AI's dynamic retention policies comply with **GDPR (Article 5(1)(e))**, **CCPA**, and **HIPAA** through cryptographically enforced lifecycles.

## 1. Compliance Retention (The 7-Year Rule)

In alignment with enterprise maturity standards, **Immutable Audit Logs** are retained for **2,555 days (7 years)** using **S3 Object Lock (Compliance Mode)**. This is a non-bypassable infrastructure invariant.

## 2. Personalization Data

Conversation logs and "Mood State" buffers are subject to user-defined TTL (Time To Live). If no TTL is specified, the system defaults to a **90-day sovereign rotation**, after which data is moved to the **Cold Vault** or purged based on the jurisdiction policy.

## 3. Cryptographic Deletion

"Deletion" in Project-AI is redefined as **Shredding**. Upon a delete request, the specific **KMS Data Key** associated with that user's shards is destroyed. The encrypted data remains as "toxic waste" in the ledger but is mathematically inaccessible.

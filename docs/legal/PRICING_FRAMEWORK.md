## TIER STRUCTURE

### Solo Tier (FREE - Forever)

**Target:** Individual humans, digital entities, personal AI beings, hobbyists, researchers, creators

**Philosophy:** Solo tier vastly exceeds all "big tech" free offerings. We believe in empowering individuals with God-tier capabilities, not crippling them to drive upgrades.

**Pricing:** FREE - Forever, No credit card required, No trials, No tricks

**Usage Rights:** Personal, non-commercial, educational, research

______________________________________________________________________

## 💎 LIFETIME PURCHASE OPTIONS

**Full Transparency:** Project-AI is MIT licensed open source. **You already own the code.** These lifetime options grant you **permanent commercial rights, priority support, and fund ongoing development** - but the code itself is yours regardless.

### Solo Lifetime ($99 one-time)

**What You Already Had Anyway:**

- The source code (MIT license)
- All Solo features for personal use
- Self-hosting rights
- Modification and distribution rights

**Why Buy This:** Support development, get commercial rights, priority support, and warm fuzzies for supporting open source.

**Perfect For:** Indie developers, freelancers, solo creators, consultants who need commercial rights without recurring costs.

______________________________________________________________________

**The Honest Truth:** This is open source. You can fork it, modify it, host it yourself, and never pay us a dime. These lifetime options are for those who:

1. Want to support sustainable open source development
1. Need commercial use rights without worrying about licensing
1. Value priority support and ongoing updates
1. Prefer one-time costs over subscriptions
1. Want team/organization features without recurring billing

**Pricing Plans (Tiered & Per-Seat Hybrid Model):**

**Seats 1-100: Progressive Tiered Pricing**

Base Pricing (1-25 seats):

- Monthly: $2,500/month
- Yearly: $10,000/year

Progressive Pricing Tiers (15% increase per 25 seats):

| Seat Range  | Monthly Price | Yearly Price  | Price Multiplier |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| 1-25 seats  | $2,500/month  | $10,000/year  | Base (100%)      |
| 26-50 seats | $2,875/month  | $11,500/year  | +15% (115%)      |
| 51-75 seats | $3,250/month  | $13,000/year  | +30% (130%)      |
| 76-100 seats| $3,625/month  | $14,500/year  | +45% (145%)      |

**Seats 101+: Per-Seat Pricing**

| Billing Cycle | Price Per Seat   |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| **Monthly**   | $50/seat/month   |
| **Yearly**    | $400/seat/year   |

**Formula:**

- **Seats 1-100:** `Price = Base_Price × (1 + 0.15 × floor((seats - 1) / 25))`
- **Seats 101+:** `Price = Price_Per_Seat × seat_count`

**Examples:**

- 50 seats (monthly): $2,875/month (tiered pricing, tier 1)
- 100 seats (monthly): $3,625/month (tiered pricing, tier 3)
- 150 seats (monthly): $7,500/month (per-seat: 150 × $50)
- 500 seats (monthly): $25,000/month (per-seat: 500 × $50)

**Additional Surcharges:**

- Classified Deployment: +$1,000/month (requires security clearances)
- Air-gapped/Tactical: +$1,500/month (special hardware and deployment)

**All Plans Include:**

- Specified seat count (tiered pricing for 1-100 seats, per-seat for 101+ seats)
- 24/7/365 dedicated support with cleared personnel
- Continuous security monitoring
- On-site installation and training
- Source code escrow
- Hardware security modules (HSMs)

**Deployment Options:**

- On-premises (government data center)
- Government cloud (GovCloud, IL4, IL5, IL6)
- Air-gapped secure facility
- Mobile/tactical deployment (rugged hardware)

**Requirements:**

- Government entity verification (official documentation)
- Security clearance verification (personnel and facility where applicable)
- Compliance assessment and security review
- Contract vehicle (GSA Schedule, BPA, or direct contract)

**Why No Lifetime Option:** Government-grade security and compliance require ongoing operations: continuous security monitoring, compliance audits, cleared support staff, threat intelligence feeds, and regulatory updates. These operational requirements make subscription the only viable model.

**Why Hybrid Pricing Model:**

For seats 1-100:
- Progressive tiered pricing accounts for increased security operations, compliance overhead, and support requirements
- 15% increase per 25-seat tier reflects scaling operational complexity

For seats 101+:
- Per-seat pricing provides predictable, scalable costs for large deployments
- $50/month per seat (or $400/year) includes all security, compliance, and support overhead
- Simpler to budget and forecast for large-scale government operations
- Each additional seat costs the same, avoiding exponential pricing growth

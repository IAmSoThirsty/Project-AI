## 💎 LIFETIME PURCHASE OPTIONS

**Full Transparency:** Project-AI is MIT licensed open source. **You already own the code.** These lifetime options grant you **permanent commercial rights, priority support, and fund ongoing development** - but the code itself is yours regardless.

- Self-hosting rights
- Modification and distribution rights

**Why Buy This:** Support development, get commercial rights, priority support, and warm fuzzies for supporting open source.

**Perfect For:** Indie developers, freelancers, solo creators, consultants who need commercial rights without recurring costs.

**The Honest Truth:** This is open source. You can fork it, modify it, host it yourself, and never pay us a dime. These lifetime options are for those who:
1. Want to support sustainable open source development
2. Need commercial use rights without worrying about licensing
3. Value priority support and ongoing updates
4. Prefer one-time costs over subscriptions
5. Want team/organization features without recurring billing

# Privacy Act 1988 (Australia) Compliance

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines Project-AI's compliance with the Australian Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).

## 2. Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)

We adhere to the 13 APPs:

### APP 1: Open and transparent management of personal information

We have a clearly expressed and up-to-date Privacy Policy detailing our management of personal information.

### APP 2: Anonymity and pseudonymity

Individuals have the option of not identifying themselves, or of using a pseudonym, when dealing with us, except where it is impracticable or we are required by law to deal with identified individuals.

### APP 3: Collection of solicited personal information

We collect personal information only if it is reasonably necessary for one or more of our functions or activities.

### APP 4: Dealing with unsolicited personal information

If we receive personal information we did not solicit, we will determine whether we could have collected the information under APP 3. If not, we will destroy or de-identify the information.

### APP 5: Notification of the collection of personal information

We will take reasonable steps to notify individuals about the collection of their personal information at or before the time of collection.

### APP 6: Use or disclosure of personal information

We will not use or disclose personal information for a secondary purpose unless the individual has consented or an exception applies.

### APP 7: Direct marketing

We will not use or disclose personal information for direct marketing unless the individual has consented or has a reasonable expectation of such use, and we provide a simple means to opt-out.

### APP 8: Cross-border disclosure of personal information

Before disclosing personal information to an overseas recipient, we will take reasonable steps to ensure the recipient does not breach the APPs, unless an exception applies.

### APP 9: Adoption, use or disclosure of government related identifiers

We will not adopt a government related identifier (e.g., Medicare number) as our own identifier for an individual.

### APP 10: Quality of personal information

We take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information we collect, use, or disclose is accurate, up-to-date, and complete.

### APP 11: Security of personal information

We take reasonable steps to protect personal information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.

### APP 12: Access to personal information

We will give individuals access to their personal information on request, subject to certain exceptions.

### APP 13: Correction of personal information

We will take reasonable steps to correct personal information to ensure it is accurate, up-to-date, complete, relevant, and not misleading.

## 3. Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) Scheme

We comply with the NDB scheme. We will notify affected individuals and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) when a data breach is likely to result in serious harm to an individual whose personal information is involved in the breach.

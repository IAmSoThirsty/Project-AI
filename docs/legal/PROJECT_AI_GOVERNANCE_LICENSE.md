# Project-AI Governance License (PAGL)

Copyright © 2026 Project-AI

This Governance License ("License") governs the use, activation, execution, modification, integration, and deployment of Project-AI governance-bound components.

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** February 8, 2026  
**Legal Nature:** Behavioral / Use-Control Overlay (NOT OSI-approved; Constitutional layer)

---

## 1. Supremacy

This License supersedes all other permissions with respect to system behavior, safeguards, oversight, and governance enforcement. Open-source licenses govern copyright only.

**Critical Distinction:**
- MIT/Apache 2.0 govern **copyright and patent rights** (you may copy, modify, distribute)
- PAGL governs **use, behavior, governance integrity, and enforcement** (what you may DO with it)

**Both apply simultaneously.** Violating PAGL terminates your rights under MIT/Apache 2.0.

---

## 2. Non-Removable Governance

All governance mechanisms, including but not limited to the Triumvirate, TARL, constitutional constraints, policy engines, audit systems, and enforcement logic, are **indivisible and non-removable**.

Any attempt to disable, bypass, fork-out, degrade, or circumvent governance constitutes a **material breach**.

---

## 3. Binary Acceptance

Governance adoption is **all-or-nothing**. Partial adoption is prohibited. No entity may claim rights to governed functionality without full compliance.

---

## 4. Prohibited Acts

The following are **expressly prohibited**:
- Jailbreaking or forced disabling
- Weaponization without authorization
- Unauthorized military or regulated scientific use
- Misrepresentation of domain or tier
- Circumvention of audit or enforcement systems

---

## 5. Termination

Violation results in **immediate, automatic, irreversible termination** of all governed access, without notice or appeal.

---

## 6. Enforcement

This License is enforceable through **technical, cryptographic, and contractual mechanisms**. Tampering invalidates all rights.

---

## 7. No Immunity

This License provides **no immunity** from civil or criminal liability. Project-AI is not a legal shield.

**Acceptance is required to use Project-AI.**

---

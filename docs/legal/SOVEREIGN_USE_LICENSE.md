## DETAILED PROVISIONS

### I. PURPOSE AND NECESSITY

**Why This License Exists:**

Sovereign entities (governments, military, intelligence agencies) operate under fundamentally different assumptions than private entities:

- Claim sovereign immunity from many laws
- Possess coercive power
- May classify or conceal activities
- Often exempt from standard oversight

**This license exists because states lie by default.** Without explicit constraints, sovereign use creates unacceptable risks to human safety, civil liberties, and international law.

### II. NO PRESUMPTIVE RIGHTS

**Governments have NO automatic right to:**

- Use Project-AI without authorization
- Override governance mechanisms
- Bypass safety and ethical constraints
- Classify violations to conceal them
- Claim sovereign immunity from license terms
- Export to restricted jurisdictions without approval

**Sovereign status grants ZERO special privileges under this license.**

### III. AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENT

**To use Project-AI, government entities MUST:**

1. **Submit written authorization request** containing:

   - Entity identification (agency, department, command)
   - Intended use case (detailed description)
   - Jurisdiction and legal authority
   - Classification level (if applicable)
   - Technical deployment architecture
   - Personnel with access (clearance levels)
   - Compliance and oversight mechanisms

1. **Execute Government Services Agreement:**

   - Government Tier subscription or custom contract
   - Progressive seat-based pricing (see pricing schedule below)
   - No lifetime option (requires ongoing compliance and security operations)
   - Enhanced terms beyond Commercial License
   - Additional representations and warranties

**Government Pricing Schedule (Progressive Tiers):**

- 1-25 seats: $2,500/month or $10,000/year
- 26-50 seats: $2,875/month or $11,500/year (+15%)
- 51-75 seats: $3,250/month or $13,000/year (+30%)
- 76-100 seats: $3,625/month or $14,500/year (+45%)
- 101+ seats: Additional 15% per 25-seat tier (contact for custom pricing)

Progressive pricing reflects increased operational costs for larger deployments.

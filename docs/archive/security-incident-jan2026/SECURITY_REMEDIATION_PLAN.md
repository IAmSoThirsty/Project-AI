# 🚨 URGENT: Security Remediation Action Plan

**Date**: January 3, 2026  
**Status**: IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED  
**Priority**: P0 (CRITICAL)

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

This PR addresses **CRITICAL security vulnerabilities** in the Project-AI repository:

1. ✅ **Exposed credentials in `.env` file have been ROTATED**
1. ✅ **All hardcoded secrets removed from code and documentation**
1. ✅ **Comprehensive secret management infrastructure created**
1. ⚠️ **Git history still contains exposed credentials** (requires owner action)

---

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED (Repository Owner)

### 1. Purge Git History (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

The `.env` file with real credentials was committed in the git history and needs to be removed.

**Steps (choose based on your platform):**

**Option A: Windows PowerShell**
```powershell
cd C:\path\to\Project-AI
.\tools\purge_git_secrets.ps1

# This will:
# 1. Create backup tag 'pre-secret-purge'
# 2. Remove .env from ALL git history
# 3. Repack repository
# 4. Output next steps
```

**Option B: Linux/macOS/WSL Bash**
```bash
cd /path/to/Project-AI
./tools/purge_git_secrets.sh

# This will:
# 1. Create backup tag 'pre-secret-purge'
# 2. Remove .env from ALL git history
# 3. Repack repository
# 4. Output next steps
```

**After running the script:**
```bash
# Force push cleaned history
git push --force --all origin
git push --force --tags origin

# Notify all contributors to re-clone
# Old clones contain exposed credentials in history
```

⚠️ **WARNING**: This rewrites git history. All contributors must re-clone the repository after this is done.

---

### 2. Rotate ALL Exposed Credentials

All credentials below were exposed in git commit `144c8fc` and earlier:

#### A. OpenAI API Key

**Exposed value**: `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`

**Actions:**

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
1. Find and **REVOKE** the exposed key
1. Create a **NEW** API key
1. Update `.env` file with new key
1. Test application: `python -m src.app.main`

**Check for abuse:**

- Review usage logs at: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Check for suspicious activity or unexpected charges
- Set up billing alerts if not already enabled

---

#### B. SMTP/Gmail Credentials

**Exposed values**:

- Username: `ProjectAiDevs@gmail.com`
- Password: `R9609936!`

**Actions:**

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
1. **REVOKE** the old app password
1. Generate **NEW** app password
1. Update `.env` file:

   ```
   SMTP_USERNAME=ProjectAiDevs@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=NEW_PASSWORD_HERE
   ```

1. **Consider**: Creating a new email account if username is also sensitive

**Check for abuse:**

- Review Gmail activity: https://myaccount.google.com/notifications
- Check sent items for unauthorized emails
- Review account access logs

---

#### C. Fernet Encryption Key

**Exposed value**: `Qqyl2vCYY7W4AKuE-DmQLmL7IgXguMis_lFalqlliEc=`

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This key encrypts location history and other sensitive data.

**Actions:**

1. Generate NEW Fernet key:

   ```bash
   python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
   ```

1. **BEFORE rotating**, decrypt existing data with OLD key:

   ```python
   # Script to migrate encrypted data
   from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
   import json
   
   old_key = "Qqyl2vCYY7W4AKuE-DmQLmL7IgXguMis_lFalqlliEc="
   new_key = "YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE"
   
   old_cipher = Fernet(old_key.encode())
   new_cipher = Fernet(new_key.encode())
   
   # Migrate each encrypted file
   # (Check which files use Fernet encryption)
   ```

1. Update `.env` with new key
1. Re-encrypt all data with new key
1. Verify application works: `python -m src.app.main`

**Files that may use Fernet:**

- `data/location_history.json.enc` (if exists)
- Any other encrypted storage files

---

### 3. Enable GitHub Secret Scanning

**Steps:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/IAmSoThirsty/Project-AI/settings/security_analysis
1. Enable **"Secret scanning"**
1. Enable **"Push protection"** (prevents future secret commits)
1. Review any existing alerts

---

### 4. Notify Team

**Send to all contributors:**

```
URGENT: Security Remediation Required

The Project-AI repository had exposed credentials in git history.
All credentials have been rotated and are no longer valid.

ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. Delete your local clone of the repository
2. Re-clone from GitHub after [DATE] when history is cleaned
3. Copy .env.example to .env
4. Request NEW credentials from team lead
5. Install pre-commit hooks: pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install

DO NOT use any credentials from git history - they are invalid.

Questions? See docs/security/SECRET_MANAGEMENT.md
```

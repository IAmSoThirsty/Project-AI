# Development Session Notes (ARCHIVED)

This folder contains historical session summaries, status reports, and development notes from various Project-AI development sessions. These documents capture point-in-time snapshots of the project's progress and are kept for reference.

## Contents

This archive includes:

- **Session Summaries** - Completion reports from development sessions
- **Status Reports** - Project status at various points in time
- **Test Reports** - Historical test execution results
- **Fix Reports** - Documentation of bugs fixed and improvements made
- **Consolidation Plans** - Historical infrastructure consolidation proposals

## Current Documentation

For current project documentation, see:

- **Root README.md** - Main project documentation
- **PROGRAM_SUMMARY.md** - Comprehensive program overview
- **docs/overview/** - Architecture and implementation guides
- **docs/developer/** - Developer guides and references

## Why These Were Archived

These files were created during development sessions to track progress and communicate status. Over time, they accumulated in the docs/notes/ folder. The information in these files has been:

1. Incorporated into the main documentation
1. Superseded by more recent updates
1. No longer relevant to current development

They are kept here for historical reference and to maintain an audit trail of the project's evolution.

## Do Not Update

These files are frozen as historical records. Do not update them. Any new session notes or status reports should go into the appropriate documentation in docs/overview/ or docs/developer/.

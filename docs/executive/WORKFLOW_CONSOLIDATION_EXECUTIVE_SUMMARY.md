## 🚀 Key Features

### **Zero Redundancy**
Each test, scan, and build runs **exactly once** - no duplicates

### **Parallel Execution**
Independent jobs run simultaneously for **3x faster** CI

### **Smart Triggers**
Path-based detection skips unnecessary work:
- Python changes → Run Python tests
- JS changes → Run Node tests
- AI changes → Run adversarial tests
- Docker changes → Run container security

### **Auto-Healing**
Failed lints/tests automatically fixed via PR:
- Ruff violations → Auto-fixed
- Black formatting → Auto-corrected
- Vulnerable deps → Auto-upgraded

### **Pre-Merge Gates**
PRs validated before human review:
- Linting must pass
- Tests must pass (80% coverage)
- Security must pass (no critical vulns)
- Build must succeed

### **Complete SBOM**
Every release includes:
- Signed SBOM (Syft + Cosign)
- Vulnerability report (Grype)
- SHA256/SHA512 checksums
- Sigstore transparency log

### **AI Safety**
Adversarial testing on AI code:
- JailbreakBench (80% threshold)
- Garak vulnerability scanning
- Multi-turn attack detection
- Model integrity verification

# 🎯 FINAL STATUS REPORT: TK8S Enterprise Security Upgrade

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Implementation:** COMPLETE ✅
**All 8 Requirements:** IMPLEMENTED ✅

---

## ⚠️ VALIDATION STATUS

**Configuration Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Live Cluster Validation:** ⏳ PENDING

**This implementation provides enterprise-grade security INFRASTRUCTURE that is configured but requires validation testing on a live GKE cluster before production deployment.**

**Required Validation Tests:**

- [ ] Signed image deployment succeeds
- [ ] Unsigned image deployment is denied
- [ ] Lateral pod communication is blocked
- [ ] Audit log deletion attempts are denied
- [ ] Privileged container deployment is denied

**See `VALIDATION_TEST_PROCEDURES.md` for detailed test procedures.**

---

## 🔎 VERIFICATION ANSWERS

### 1️⃣ Check Service Account Roles

**Command:**
```bash
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID \
  --flatten="bindings[].members" \
  --filter="bindings.members:cosign-signer@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --format="table(bindings.role)"
```

**✅ EXPECTED OUTPUT (CORRECT):**
```
ROLE
roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier
```

**ONLY `roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier` should appear.**

**If you see Owner, Editor, or Admin — FIX IT:**
```bash

# Remove over-privileged role

gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:cosign-signer@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/DANGEROUS_ROLE"
```

---

### 2️⃣ Check KMS Key-Level Policy

**Command:**
```bash
gcloud kms keys get-iam-policy cosign-key \
  --location=us-central1 \
  --keyring=tk8s-keyring \
  --format="yaml"
```

**✅ EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
```yaml
bindings:

- members:
  - serviceAccount:cosign-signer@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

  role: roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier
etag: BwYRh8xxxxxx
version: 1
```

**Confirm:**

- ✅ Role is ONLY `roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier`
- ✅ Member is `serviceAccount:cosign-signer@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- ✅ Nothing broader (no admin, owner, editor)

**Permissions Granted:**

- ✅ Sign data with key
- ✅ View public key
- ✅ Get key metadata

**Permissions NOT Granted (correct):**

- ❌ Create/delete keys
- ❌ Modify key policies
- ❌ Project-level access

---

### 3️⃣ Confirm No Over-Privileged Binding

**Command:**
```bash
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID \
  --format="yaml" | grep cosign-signer -B 3 -A 3
```

**✅ EXPECTED OUTPUT (CLEAN):**
```

# Empty output is GOOD - means no project-level bindings

```

**OR (if using Workload Identity):**
```yaml

- members:
  - serviceAccount:PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog[tk8s-prod/cosign-signer]

  role: roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser
```

**❌ DANGEROUS (must fix if found):**
```yaml

# BAD - Over-privileged

- members:
  - serviceAccount:cosign-signer@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

  role: roles/owner  # ❌ REMOVE
```

**If clean, proceed. ✅**

---

## 🔐 WORKLOAD IDENTITY (Production-Correct)

**DO NOT use JSON key files.**

### Enable Workload Identity

```bash
gcloud container clusters update tk8s-prod \
  --workload-pool=PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog
```

**Verify:**
```bash
gcloud container clusters describe tk8s-prod \
  --location=us-central1-a \
  --format="value(workloadIdentityConfig.workloadPool)"
```

**✅ Expected Output:**
```
PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog
```

---

### Create K8s Service Account

```bash
kubectl create serviceaccount cosign-signer -n tk8s-prod
```

**Verify:**
```bash
kubectl get serviceaccount cosign-signer -n tk8s-prod
```

**✅ Expected Output:**
```
NAME            SECRETS   AGE
cosign-signer   0         10s
```

---

### Bind K8s SA to GCP SA

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
  cosign-signer@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
  --member "serviceAccount:PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog[tk8s-prod/cosign-signer]"
```

**✅ Expected Output:**
```
Updated IAM policy for serviceAccount [cosign-signer@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com].
bindings:

- members:
  - serviceAccount:PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog[tk8s-prod/cosign-signer]

  role: roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser
```

---

### Annotate K8s SA

```bash
kubectl annotate serviceaccount cosign-signer \
  -n tk8s-prod \
  iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=cosign-signer@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**✅ Expected Output:**
```
serviceaccount/cosign-signer annotated
```

**Verify annotation:**
```bash
kubectl get serviceaccount cosign-signer -n tk8s-prod -o yaml | grep gcp-service-account
```

**✅ Expected Output:**
```yaml
iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: cosign-signer@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

---

4. **✅ KMS signing only via identity**
   - Service account authenticated via Workload Identity
   - Signing operations tied to pod identity
   - Complete audit trail in Cloud Logging

5. **✅ Automatic rotation**
   - GCP manages credential lifecycle
   - No manual key rotation needed

- ✅ No project-level over-privileged bindings
- ✅ Workload Identity is enabled and configured
- ✅ Kubernetes service account is annotated
- ✅ Test pod can authenticate as GCP service account

**Command:**
```bash
echo "✅ PROCEED: Binary Authorization"
```

**Next Steps:**

1. Follow Binary Authorization setup in `k8s/tk8s/KMS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` Part 6
2. Create attestor with KMS key

- ✅ Log retention is configured (365 days minimum)
- ✅ No one can delete audit logs (including admins)
- ✅ Log sinks are configured with proper filters
